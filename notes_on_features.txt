Below is the list of assignment 4 requirements and my features which fulfill these requirements.

Implement â€‹CheckIntersect

Have at least two bitmap based sprites each of which does at least one of the following:

moves around the screen - Both bitmaps move around the screen
rotates - the turtle rotates while colliding with bullet
animates by switching bitmaps - turtle also switches bitmaps while colliding with bullet

Have at least one of these sprites respond to mouse - bullet jumps to location of mouse click
Have at least one of these sprites respond to keyboard - turtle velocity can be changed via WASD, turtle also bounces off walls.

Must have some response to the collision of your sprites. 
Examples include, but notlimited to:
change in direction
